# PhotoMosaic-Generator

A PhotoMosaic is a picture created by taking some source picture, dividing it up into rectangular sections, and replacing each section with a tiny image whose color closely approximates the color of the section it replaces. 

This project is to map tile images to the rectangular sections of pixels in the source image with k-d Tree in order to generate photoMosaic effect.
